# MOS-Simulator
## Function of MOSSimulator:
### 1.Simulate the relationship between surface potential and space charge density of semiconductor in the metal-oxide-semiconductor system.
### 2.Simulate the impact of oxide thinkness, oxide dielectric constant and semiconductor doping concentration on the C-V curve.
